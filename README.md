# hippo_morph_old
The old, clunky, and outdated code for my hippocampal morphometry pipeline. The scripts located here are for documentation/preservation purposes only and have largely been replaced by my Python-based workflow.

Primarily BASH script-based. Requires [hippodeep_pytorch](https://github.com/bthyreau/hippodeep_pytorch) and [SlicerSALT](https://salt.slicer.org/).

Refer to comments in code for directions on properly running these scripts.
